*Last updated: nn month yyyy*

<!-- This template is for getting started with a Bluemix service. It is a task template intended to document productive use of the service. It is not intended for discovery and conceptual information.  -->

<!-- The short description section should include one to three sentences describing why a developer would want to use your service in an app. This should be conversational style. For search engine optimization, include the service long name and "Bluemix". 

Examples: -->

IBM Single Sign On is a policy-based authentication service for Bluemix. With Single Sign On, you can easily embed single sign-on capability in Node.js or Liberty for Java apps. -OR-
With IBM IoT Real-Time Insights on Bluemix, you can perform analytics on real-time data from your Internet of Things devices, and gain insights about their health and the overall state of your operations.  -OR-
Use IBM BigInsights for Apache Hadoop for Bluemix to provision enterprise-scale, multi-node big data clusters on the IBM SoftLayer cloud. After they are provisioned, you can manage and access these clusters from the BigInsights service.

<!-- The task section includes steps to integrate the service into the app.  
- DO NOT include an overview section. 
- With task-based, technical information, reduce the conversational style in favor of succinct and direct instructions.
- DO include the basic, most-common-use scenario steps to use the service or integrate it into the app. 
- DO NOT include steps to add the service from the Bluemix catalog; we assume that the user already took steps in the UI to add the service. 
- For additional tasks like configuring, managing, etc., include a separate task topic. Use a task title such as "Configuring x", "Administering y", "Managing z". 
- DO include code snippets in all languages that can be copied, as well as VCAP service info.  -->

<!-- You can include an optional prerequisites paragraph for any prerequisites to be met before integrating the service. For example: -->

Before an application developer can embed single sign-on capability into an app, the administrator must create unbound service instances by using the Bluemix user interface.

<!-- Include a sentence to briefly introduce the steps. Examples: -->

To integrate your app with the service, complete these steps: -OR-
To get up and running quickly with this service, follow these steps: -OR-
Complete these steps to get started with the BigInsights service:

<!-- Use ordered list markup for the step section. Include examples as needed. -->

2. Step 2 to integrate app with the service.```

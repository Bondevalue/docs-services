# Getting started with Plaid
{: #gettingstarted_plaid}

Plaid is a financial infrastructure provider that makes it easy to access high-quality transaction data, validate account ownership, and mitigate risks in a user-friendly way.
{:shortdesc}

<!-- Task section: REQUIRED
The task section includes steps to integrate the service into the app.  
- With task-based, technical information, reduce the conversational style in favor of succinct and direct instructions.
- DO include the basic, most-common-use scenario steps to use the service or integrate it into the app. 
- DO NOT include steps to add the service from the Bluemix catalog; we assume that the user already took steps in the UI to add the service. 
- DO include code snippets in all languages that can be copied, as well as VCAP service info.  
- For additional tasks like configuring, managing, etc., add a task section (## Gerund_task_title) below the task section or "About" section if used. Use a task title such as "Configuring x", "Administering y", "Managing z". -->

<!-- You can include an optional prerequisites paragraph for any prerequisites to be met before integrating the service. For example: -->

<!-- Include a sentence to briefly introduce the steps. Examples: -->

Once you've signed up to using Plaid, there are a few easy steps to go live.

<!-- Use ordered list markup for the step section. For code examples: 
- use three backticks ahead of and after the example (```)
- For copyable code snippet, multi-line, include {: codeblock} following the last set of backticks. A copy button will display in framework in output.
- For copyable command, single line, include {: pre} following the last set of backticks. When displayed, it will show "$" at the beginning of the command example and a copy button, but the copy button will include just the command example.
- For non-copyable output snippet, include {: screen} following the last set of backticks.

1. Step 1. Review our comprehensive [Documentation](https://plaid.com/docs/api/){:new_window} and [Quickstart guide](https://plaid.com/docs/quickstart/){:new_window} -- designed to make it as easy as possible to get up-and-running with Plaid.
2. Step 2. Integrate with Plaid Link, a drop-in module that provides a secure, elegant authentication flow for each financial institution that Plaid supports.
3. Step 3. For the best experience, copy your Plaid API keys from the Plaid Dashboard into the Bluemix Developer portal (note: never share your Plaid API keys outside of the Bluemix Developer portal!).
4. Step 4. Start using Plaid!

Note that Plaid is free for the first 100 users. Once you reach 100 users, you'll need to request Production access in the Plaid dashboard.

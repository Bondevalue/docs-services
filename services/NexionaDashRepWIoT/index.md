# Getting started with MIIMETIQ Dashboards and Reports for Watson IoT
{: #gettingstarted}

NEXIONA presents MIIMETIQ Dashboards and Reports; a simple way to create custom Reports and Dashboards for your Watson IoT Proof of Concept. As new 'widgets' are added, data from devices is immediately displayed either as a current value, values over time (in graphical or tabular view) or located on a map. Multiple layouts can be created per project. An ideal way to prove concepts before scaling up to the full project using the Watson IoT Platform. {:shortdesc}

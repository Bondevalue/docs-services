Before an application developer can embed single sign-on capability into an app, the administrator must create unbound service instances by using the Bluemix user interface.

To integrate your app with the service, complete these steps: -OR- To get up and running quickly with this service, follow these steps: -OR- Complete these steps to get started with the BigInsights service:

Step 1 to integrate app with the service.
Step 2 to integrate app with the service.

Copyable example for this step. 
This example might be multiline code
to copy into a file. 
When displayed in the doc framework, 
it will have a copy button on the right.
The user can click to copy the example 
so they can paste it into their code editor.

Step 3. In this step, we have a single line command example. When displayed by the doc framework, it will have a $ shown at the beginning of the line, and a copy button on the right. The copy button will copy the command but not the $.

my command -and -options

Step 4

This is a bunch of output from
    a command or program I ran
        and it can run lots of lines
        and the doc framework will show it as 
        output with no copy button.

## Test Automation

Developing mobile applications is very different from developing PC
software or even embedded software. Mobile development is meant to be
agile, and a lot of great tools and practices have been developed for
that agility. However, doing something manually — such as testing an
app — is never agile, which is why test automation has shown
tremendous growth among app and game developers, speeding up their
doings and yielding robust and better results.

All Testdroid product have been built for test automation. The remote
manual access to devices on our data centers complements this offering
and occasionally developers want to make sure their apps work just
like they've planned - and this is where our Testdroid Interactive is
extremely useful.

Test Automation relies real mobile devices (Android, iOS) and offers
the possibility to test mobile apps and websites instantly and
effectively using test automation frameworks. Our infrastructure is
build to support unlimited number of simultaneous test runs, meaning
that you can select any number of devices for your test run.

The true benefit of test automation comes from these simultanous test
runs, automated access, coverage, and runs on devices, repeatability
nature of tests, and identical and accurate tests - that could
probably never get to accurate with manual testing.

* **Open Standards** - Our test automation relies only on open
     standards that are widely used in the industry. Open standards
     mean there are no vendor lock-ins, source code is always open and
     available, and developers can incrementally develop new tests and
     focus on compelling features with their apps.

* **Automation without Complexity** - Automated testing can increase
     the depth and scope of tests and significantly improve software
     quality. Lengthy and thorough tests — often not doable with
     manual testing — can be run automatically. Automated tests can
     easily execute thousands of complex test cases during every test
     run, providing coverage that is simply not possible with manual
     testing.

* **Cost Efficient and Effective** - Depending on the size of the
     project and the application, test automation will always provide
     a good return on investment. Once tests have been created,
     automated tests can be run over and over again at no additional
     cost. Test automation typically reduces the time required to run
     repetitive tests from weeks to hours. This is a significant
     time-saving that translates directly into cost-saving.

* **Integration with Agile Process and Tools** - To get the most out
     of your efforts and maximize testing coverage, select the most
     robust and most cross-platform method - and hook it up with your
     continuous integration, development and deployment system. Once
     you build an app, the system can automatically push it for
     testing on devices on cloud. This saves a lot of time, produces
     instant results and developers can fix any issues instantly.

In order to automate your mobile testing, you can use different types
of procedures and methods to accomplish the real device coverage,
compatibility and full functional testing. For example, there are
three ways to produce tests for any mobile application:

* **Handwritten Tests** - Typically, this is the best choice when you
     know what you’re doing and when you have programming-capable
     people doing the test scripts. Plenty of options are available
     for test automation frameworks, tools and integration — both
     commercial and open-source offerings. Having your engineers write
     all of the test scripts will take up some time and tie up
     resources, but it will get you exactly what you want:
     well-structured, thorough scripts that test precisely the aspects
     of your app that you want to test.

* **Record and Playback Approach** - This approach is less
     error-prone because nothing needs to be written in code, but it
     is typically more limited in functionality. Tests can be quickly
     recorded and then played back again and again against different
     OS versions and device configurations. These tests focus on user
     interactions and user-driven activities. Some things might fall
     beyond a test’s scope (such as integration with other
     technologies and compatibility with other software).

* **Automatic Test Exercisers** - Automatic test exercisers provide a
     great way to smoke-test applications. No specific tests are
     needed; rather, the focus is on testing user-interface logic
     (such as opening menus, clicking buttons, swiping and
     multi-gesture actions). Automatic test exercisers yield the least
     exact results but provide quick feedback on each iteration of an
     app.

In order to evaluate what test automation framework works you the best
please take a look our comparison of each and if needed please consult
us to find you and your app the most suitable test automation
framework.

## Remote Manual Access

Remote manual access allows you to start a session on any mobile
device we host at Testdroid Cloud. This provides a comprehensive way
to manually test your mobile apps, games and web-related products. As
all these devices are real you can install other applications, use
available browsers, internet access, and also Google Play / App Store
to download and configure your device session.

The feature is called Testdroid Interactive. By clicking *Manual testing*
in the main menu, user will be directed to the *Manual testing* setup view.

Users can upload their applications by clicking *Upload file* on top of
the widget and then select application for a manual session.

1. Select application for the session

   The interactive session gets started by clicking the
   application. More applications can be uploaded and all are shown in
   this view. If you don't have or don't want to upload any app you can
   also proceed without it.

2. Select a device for the session

   User can pick up the device and use filters on the left-hand side
   to quickly browse desired device. NOTE! If certain device is not
   available (used by some other user) it will be shown with grayed
   lock picture on top of it.

   After this the Interactive session will be opened with the selected
   application installed on device.

3. Use selected device

   During the session, users can use external buttons to do the
   following adjustments for the device, session and tests:

   *Power* – Switch the device off / end session.

   *Volume* – speaker volume can be turned up or down.

   *Rotate* – the device in session can be switched to portrait and landscape mode.

   *Screenshot* – Take a screenshot of device session. The screenshot
   will be shown in Taken screenshots widget next to the Interactive
   widget.

   *Device logs* - The device logs for Interactive session will show
   live log details next to the Interactive session widget.

4. Stop or Restart

   User can also stop the manual testing session by clicking on the
   timer button on top of the widget.

   To restart the session user should click on the restart arrow also
   on top of widget.

test runs, including key metrics or even full details of each test
runs.
 
For example, user can select the project, test run, report type and
report format, and the report will be automatically generated for
user. It is also possible to download the report in different formats
(PDF, HTML, CSV).

![](http://docs.testdroid.com/assets/testdroid-cloud-ui/reports.png)

The following steps will help users to create reports regarding their
needs:

1. **Specify the report type.** After selecting the reports tool, the
first step is to specify the report type. Users can choose different
report types from the dropdown list placed in the upper left part of
the module. The report type list is divided into two parts: "Projects"
(reports for projects) and "Test runs" (reports for test runs). After
you select an option in this list the values in the other two
drop-downs menu will be updated accordingly.

2. **Choose the data source.** When user have specified the type of
report, user can choose from which of the projects/test runs user
wants to generate the report.

3. **Specify report format.** In the last drop-down menu you can choose
your preferred format (PDF, HTML or CSV).

4. **Preview window.** When user starts the reports module the preview
window is hidden. Users can activate the preview window by clicking
the text "Change selected values or click this text to refresh
preview" or by changing values in the drop-down lists. Thanks to the
preview window users can review reports before downloading them. The
preview window refreshes after every change is made.

5. **Downloading reports.** Last, when users are happy with their
reports, they can download the selected report by clicking the
"Download report" button.

## Device Groups

Testdroid Cloud enables its users to create a specific device groups
that are used to point out on which devices tests are executed. The
device group configuration can be found under the main menu - **Device
Groups**.
 
Creation of a device group starts by giving a name for device
group. After this, user needs to select either to be created device
group is Android or iOS. Note that device groups can include devices
from either platform, not both. By clicking **Create group** the
device group will be created.
 
Users can include devices in device groups by selecting device
separately on the left-hand side's browsing menu. After selection,
user can drag and drop devices to newly created device group on the
right-hand side.  The filter options on the left-hand side, for
example, OS versions, API levels, CPUs and so on can be used to browse
specific devices for selection.
 
![](http://docs.testdroid.com/assets/testdroid-cloud-ui/device_groups.png)
 
The other alternative for creating device groups is to select all
desired devices on the left-hand side widget and clicking '+' on top
of that widget. User can then configure more specific details -
e.g. name - on the right-hand side widget.
 
The third way to configure device groups is enabled by clicking
existing device group on the right-hand side widget. Devices included
in the specific group will be shown and user can remove and add
devices accordingly.

## Manual Testing

Testdroid Cloud Manual Testing feature provides users a way to take
manual access to Testdroid Cloud devices. By clicking Manual Testing in
the main menu, user will be directed to the Manual Testing setup view.

![](http://docs.testdroid.com/assets/logos/Testdroid_CLOUD_logo-HORIZONTAL_800px.png)

[Testdroid Cloud](https://cloud.testdroid.com/) provides the largest
device farm of real mobile devices, gathered from different regions
globally, including the most versatile OS, OEM and hardware
configurations for Android and iOS developers. Testdroid Cloud
provides a test automation, remote manual access and REST API to
access, run and manage any tests with these devices.

Testdroid Cloud is a mobile app, game and web testing service that
enables developers to run their tests on real, physical Android and
iOS devices that are all hosted on our secure premises. These devices
are hosted in three different locations - Wroclaw, Poland, Mountain
View, CA and Oulu, Finland - and are monitored and maintained 24 hours
per business day. Our up-time is over 99% and sophisticated monitoring
system keeps our devices running at the same rate.

Testdroid Cloud allows users to upload their own tests or use
built-in, script-free compatibility tests and crawlers. Devices can be
used in parallel with test automation frameworks. For remote manual
access only one device can be used at time.

Testdroid Cloud provides support for native, hybrid and web apps on
Android and iOS devices and browsers. Any applications created on
PhoneGap, Titanium, Unity or some other framework are fully supported
at Testdroid Cloud devices.

The supported test automation frameworks include:

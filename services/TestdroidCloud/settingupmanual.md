# Setting up remote manual access
{: #setting_up_manual} 

*Last updated: 16 May 2016*

Remote manual access allows you to start a session on any mobile device we host at Testdroid Cloud. This provides a comprehensive way to manually test your mobile apps, games and web-related products. As all these devices are real you can install other applications, use available browsers, internet access, and also Google Play / App Store to download and configure your device session.

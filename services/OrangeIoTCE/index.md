# Getting started with Orange IoT Connect Express on Bluemix
{: #gettingstarted}

Orange IoT Connect Express provides a simpler and more efficient way to manage all your SIM cards, personalize their services, carry out remote analysis and reduce your operational costs. Our M2M API enables you to build services that seamlessly integrate all the information provided by your M2M SIM cards, allowing you to manage your SIM fleet in real-time.

To get started using Orange IoT Connect Express check out the full [Services overview](./OrangeIoTCE_Services_overview_v1.2.pdf).

To get up and running quickly with Orange IoT Express Connect follow these steps:

1. Step 1 to integrate app with the service.
2. Step 2 to integrate app with the service.

	```
	Copyable example for this step. 
	This example might be multiline code
	to copy into a file. 
	When displayed in the doc framework, 
	it will have a copy button on the right.
	The user can click to copy the example 
	so they can paste it into their code editor.
	```
	{: codeblock}

3. Step 3. In this step, we have a single line command example. When displayed by the doc framework, it will have a $ shown at the beginning of the line, and a copy button on the right. The copy button will copy the command but not the $.

	```
	my command -and -options
	```
	{: pre}

4. Step 4
	```
	This is a bunch of output from
		a command or program I ran
			and it can run lots of lines
			and the doc framework will show it as 
			output with no copy button.
	```
